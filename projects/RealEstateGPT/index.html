Although the subject of this paper is ostensibly the computable numbers. it is almost equally easy to define and investigate computable functions of an integral variable or a real or computable variable, computable predicates, and so forth. The fundamental problems involved are, however, the same in each case, and I have chosen the computable numbers for explicit treatment as involving the least cumbrous technique. I hope shortly to give an account of the relations of the computable numbers, functions, and so forth to one another. This will include a development of the theory of functions of a real variable expressed in terms of computable numbers. According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine... </div> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <p>The paper “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem” was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.</p> <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2> <p>Turing’s main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.</p> <h2 id="key-ideas">Key Ideas</h2> <ol> <li>Turing first presented the concept of a “computable number,” which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.</li> <li>He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.</li> <li>Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.</li> <li>He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.</li> <li>Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.</li> </ol> <p><img src="/static/image/Turing_machine.png" alt="Turing Machine"></p> <p><em>Figure 1: A representation of a Turing Machine.

The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing’s work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.</p> <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"> <div class="column is-four-fifths"> <h2>Demo Figures</h2> </div> </div> <p>We provide some demos for DriveGPT4 generated conversations.</p> <hr> <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2> <p>For any questions, please send email to neverset at aliyun dot com。</p> <hr> <h2 id="citation">Citation</h2> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@article{xu2023drivegpt4,
