This project seeks to apply LLMs to the real estate data by introducing a novel interpretable and predictable price estimatation and recommandation system based on LLMs. with its capability of processing multimodal input data, LLM facilitates the interpretation of unstructured data in different formats, and effectively reasoning and extracting usefull data for further recommandation. These estimation and recommandation capabilities are achieved through the utilization of dataset from Immowelt and ImmoScout24 through targetted finetuning strategy. The fine-tuning of domain-specific data enables LLM to yield accurate results in terms of real estate property estimation and further investment recommandation. </div> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2> <p>Estimating real estate prices involves analyzing various factors that influence the value of a property. This RealEstateGPT will provice a comprehensive guide to estimating real estate price by including location, perperty characteristics, market conditions and comparable sale data.</p> <h2 id="key-ideas">Key Ideas</h2> <p>The key idea behind a RealEstateGPT is to leverage advanced language models to assist in various aspects of the real estate industry. This AI-powered tool could provide valuable insights, streamline processes, and enhance decision-making for real estate professionals, investors, and buyers. The core functionalities and benefits are:</p> <ol> <li>Market Analysis and Insights Trend Analysis: Identify and analyze market trends based on vast amounts of data from multiple sources, including historical prices, sales data, and economic indicators. Neighborhood Analysis: Provide detailed insights into neighborhood characteristics, including amenities, crime rates, school ratings, and demographic information.</li> <li>Property Valuation Automated Valuation Models (AVMs): Generate accurate property value estimates by analyzing comparable sales, market conditions, and property attributes. Price Predictions: Predict future property values based on market trends, economic forecasts, and other influencing factors.</li> <li>Customer Assistance Virtual Assistance: Offer potential buyers and renters a virtual assistant to answer questions, provide property recommendations, and schedule viewings. Personalized Recommendations: Suggest properties to buyers and investors based on their preferences, budget, and investment goals.</li> <li>Investment Analysis ROI Calculations: Provide detailed return on investment (ROI) analyses for potential investment properties. Risk Assessment: Evaluate and highlight potential risks associated with real estate investments, including market volatility and property-specific issues.</li> </ol> <h2 id="technical-steps">technical steps</h2> <ol> <li>Data collection: collect public and commercial real estate data by API and scraping</li> <li>Customization: Tailor the large language model to understand specific real estate terminology, regulations, and market conditions.</li> <li>User Interface Development: Develop user-friendly interfaces for real estate professionals and customers to interact with the AI.</li> </ol> <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"> <div class="column is-four-fifths"> <h2>Project Structure</h2> <p align="center"> <img style="width: 49%" src="img/structure.png"> </p> </div> </div> <hr> <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2> <p>For any questions, please send email to neverset at aliyun dot comã€‚</p> <hr> </div> </div> </section> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container"> <div class="columns is-centered"> <div class="column is-8"> <div class="content"> <p> Website template borrowed from <a href="https://github.com/nerfies/nerfies.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NeRFies</a>. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
