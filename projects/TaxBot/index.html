With its capability of processing multimodal input data(image, text and table), this smart agent RealEstateGPT will facilitate the interpretation of various data sources and data formats, and effectively generate useful market analysis, property valuation and customer assistance in real estate market.</p> <p>These analysis and recommandation capabilities of RealEstateGPT are achieved through targetted LLMs finetuning with domain-specific dataset and real time market information. User could not only get specific market object report, but also interactivly ask the agent for further investment recommandation in terms of real estate property.</p> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"> <div class="column is-four-fifths"> <h2>Business Model</h2> <div class="content has-text-justified"> The RealEstateGPT will be provided as SaaS(Software as s Service), which allows users to utilize the power of LLMs without having to train the models themselves. Users pay a fee based on the amount of usage or a monthlich subscription fee without usage amount limitation. </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"> <div class="column is-four-fifths"> <h2>Objective</h2> <div class="content has-text-justified"> Estimating real estate prices involves analyzing various factors that influence the value of a property. This RealEstateGPT will provide a comprehensive guide to estimating real estate property value by including location, perperty characteristics, market conditions and comparable sale data. </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"> <div class="column is-four-fifths"> <h2>Key Ideas</h2> <div class="content has-text-justified"> <p>The key idea behind a RealEstateGPT is to leverage advanced LLMs to assist in various aspects of the real estate industry. This AI-powered tool could provide valuable insights, streamline processes, and enhance decision-making for real estate professionals, investors, and buyers. The core functionalities and benefits are:</p> <p>1. Market Analysis and Insights</p> <p>Trend Analysis: Identify and analyze market trends based on vast amounts of data from multiple sources, including historical prices, sales data, and economic indicators.</p> <p>Neighborhood Analysis: Provide detailed insights into neighborhood characteristics, including amenities, crime rates, school ratings, and demographic information.</p> <p>2. Property Valuation</p> <p>Automated Valuation Models (AVMs): Generate accurate property value estimates by analyzing comparable sales, market conditions, and property attributes.</p> <p>Price Predictions: Predict future property values based on market trends, economic forecasts, and other influencing factors.</p> <p>3. Customer Assistance</p> <p>Virtual Assistance: Offer potential buyers and renters a virtual assistant to answer questions, provide property recommendations, and schedule viewings.</p> <p>Personalized Recommendations: Suggest properties to buyers and investors based on their preferences, budget, and investment goals.</p> <p>4. Investment Analysis</p> <p>ROI Calculations: Provide detailed return on investment (ROI) analyses for potential investment properties.</p> <p>Risk Assessment: Evaluate and highlight potential risks associated with real estate investments, including market volatility and property-specific issues.</p> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"> <div class="column is-four-fifths"> <h2>Technical Architecture</h2> <p align="center"> <img style="width: 100%" src="img/structure.png"> </p> <div class="content has-text-justified"> <p>1. Data Preprocessing: clean and preprocess input unstructured data with cognitive recognization model to extract meaningful information</p> <p>2. Embedding: extracted data in different format are converted to unified embeddings with fine-tuned LLM</p> <p>3. ML Prediction: vector embeddings are fed into trained ML model to get the predictions </p> <p>4. User Interaction: users are allowed to input natural language queries or commands, which the LLM then processes to interact with the embeddings.</p> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"> <div class="column is-four-fifths"> <h2>Demo Video</h2> <p align="center"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_tLK0vW2Y78?si=JFRXep9HFeF-ttik" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"> <div class="column is-four-fifths"> <h2>Contact</h2> <div class="content has-text-justified"> For any questions, please send email to neverset at aliyun dot comã€‚ </div> </div> </div> <hr> </body></html>
