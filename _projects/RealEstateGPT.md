        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
        
<p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent tool for different areas , given their proficiency in handling and reasoning with unstructured data, including image, text and numbers. This project seeks to apply LLMs to the real estate data by introducing a novel interpretable and predictable price estimatation and recommandation system based on LLMs. with its capability of processing multimodal input data, LLM facilitates the interpretation of unstructured data in different formats, and effectively reasoning and extracting usefull data for further recommandation. </p>
<p>These estimation and recommandation capabilities are achieved through the utilization of dataset from Immowelt and ImmoScout24 through targetted finetuning strategy. The fine-tuning of domain-specific data enables LLM to yield accurate results in terms of real estate property estimation and further investment recommandation.</p>
