        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
<p>In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence in financial services has led to the emergence of advanced tax advisory systems </p>
<p>This project seeks to develop a Tax Advisory Chatbot leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for maximal tax return.  The chatbot is designed to assist individuals and businesses in navigating complex tax regulations, providing real-time, accurate, and personalized tax advice.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the chatbot is achieved through finetuned LLM's contextual understanding of natural language and vector-based search techniques. Extensive tax laws, regulations, and case precedents, ensuring comprehensive coverage and up-to-date information are incorporated in the system.</p>

        <h2>Business Model</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
This smart agent holds the potential to democratize access to tax expertise, particularly for small businesses and individual taxpayers who may lack resources for professional advisory services. It will be provided as Pay-as-you-Go mode, which allows users to utilize the power of LLMs by paying a fix amount of fee for each tax filing.
