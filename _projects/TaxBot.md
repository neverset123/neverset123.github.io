        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
<p>In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence in financial services has led to the emergence of advanced tax advisory systems </p>
<p>This project seeks to develop a Tax Advisory Chatbot leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).  The chatbot is designed to assist individuals and businesses in navigating complex tax regulations, providing real-time, accurate, and personalized tax advice.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the chatbot is achieved through finetuned LLM's contextual understanding of natural language and vector-based search techniques. Extensive tax laws, regulations, and case precedents, ensuring comprehensive coverage and up-to-date information are incorporated in the system.</p>

        <h2>Business Model</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
This smart agent holds the potential to democratize access to tax expertise, particularly for small businesses and individual taxpayers who may lack resources for professional advisory services. It will be provided as Pay-as-you-Go mode, which allows users to utilize the power of LLMs by paying a fix amount of fee for each tax declaration.

        <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
<p>The key idea behind the TaxBot is its contextual understanding and capabilities to handle complex tax scenarios and multilingual support. Key usage ideas for this Tax Advisory Chatbot are:</p>

<p>1. Personalized Tax Guidance</p>
<p>The chatbot can provide tailored tax advice based on individual or business-specific financial situations, taking into account factors such as income, expenses, deductions, and credits to optimize tax outcomes.</p>
<p>2. Real-Time Tax Queries</p>
<p>Users can ask the chatbot tax-related questions at any time, receiving immediate and accurate responses. This can be particularly useful during tax season when timely information is critical.</p>
<p>3. Filing Assistance</p>
<p>The chatbot can guide users through the tax filing process, step-by-step, ensuring that all necessary forms are completed correctly and all potential deductions and credits are claimed.</p>
<p>4. Regulation Updates</p>
<p>The chatbot can keep users informed about the latest changes in tax laws and regulations, helping them stay compliant and take advantage of new tax-saving opportunities.</p>
<p>5. Audit Preparation</p>
<p>In the event of a tax audit, the chatbot can help users prepare by explaining the process, advising on necessary documentation, and offering strategies to address potential auditor questions.</p>

<p>1. Data Preprocessing: clean and preprocess input unstructured data with cognitive recognization model to extract meaningful information</p>
<p>2. Embedding: extracted data in different format are converted to unified embeddings with fine-tuned LLM</p>
<p>3. ML Prediction: vector embeddings are fed into trained ML model to get the predictions </p>
<p>4. User Interaction: users are allowed to input natural language queries or commands, which the LLM then processes to interact with the embeddings.</p>
