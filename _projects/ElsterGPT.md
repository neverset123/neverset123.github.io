        <div class="content has-text-justified">
<p>In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence in financial services has led to the emergence of advanced tax advisory systems. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of the agent is achieved through fine-tuned LLM's contextual natural language processing capabilities and accurate retrival of relevant tax laws from vector database. By incorperating extensive tax laws, regulations, and case precedents in Machine Learning(ML) model during drafting and reviewing tax documents a higher-quality of decision-making will be significantly enhanced.</p>

        <h2>Business Model</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
This smart agent holds the potential to democratize access to tax expertise, particularly for small businesses and individual taxpayers who may lack resources for professional advisory services. It will be provided as Pay-as-you-Go mode, which allows users to utilize the power of LLMs by paying a fix amount of fee for each tax filing.
