Hello, this is YW Wang. Currently I work as a staff developer for Mercedes Benz focusing on generative AI.

Prior to joining MB, I have worked for tier 1 supplier Continental as Software Developer, and received my MSc. Degree from the Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH Aachen). 

My primary research and develop interests encompass a broad range of topics, including scene understanding, end-to-end learning, multimodal perception, large language model reasoning and more. My specific focus is on the application of computer vision and robotics techniques to develop trustworthy and reliable autonomous driving systems and agents that will be running in the real world.

Drop me an email if you are interested in collaborations in any forms!
